# Gmail-Dot-Trick

The place you enter in the username section should not be a random email address section. 
When you use the e-mails it automatically generates for you on any platform, your confirmation code will be sended to the e-mail you entered in the Username section. 
(e.g My email address is test@gmail.com, I can use t.est@gmail.com or te.st@gmail.com. Confirmation code will be sended to test@gmail.com again)

If the code doesnt work when you open the html file
I created a solution for this on "Issues"
You can fix it
